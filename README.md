# plasma-profile
A uml profile project for Plasma. UML profiles based on Eclipse Papyrus
must be edited with Papyrus itself and this repo 
is dedicated solely to the maintenance of the Plasma 
profile. Edited profiles must be "defined" using Papyrus 
and saved, then coped to a specific version, found in the
root directory of the repo. 
Defined versions of the profile are then copied to the plasma-eclipse plugins
repo and the Plasma repo.
